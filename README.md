# sentiment-analysis

Python notebook project for building, training, and testing a **Naive-Bayes sentiment analysis model** from scratch. Structured + written for programming beginners.

Features:
- Not object-based to be more beginner-friendly
- Detailed instructions and hints.

Inspired by the process illustrated [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/4.pdf) and the code structure from [this blog post](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/movie-review-sentiment-analysis-with-naive-bayes-machine-learning-from-scratch-part-v-7bb869391bab?gi=7630074b4e3c). 

Files:
- `solution.ipynb` contains one possible solution code for this model -- a completed model with `~93%` accuracy -- along with the write-up. 
- `starter.ipynb` contains the write-up only -- as it could be distributed to students.
